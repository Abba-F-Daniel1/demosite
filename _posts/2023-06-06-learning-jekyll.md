Science is a systematic and logical approach to discovering how things in the universe work. It is a way of building knowledge about the natural world through observation, experimentation, and the development of theories that can be tested and refined. Science involves making observations, asking questions, forming hypotheses, testing those hypotheses through experiments or further observations, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions ยน.

Science is a dynamic and ongoing process that continually refines and expands our understanding of the world around us. It is not a collection of static facts, but rather a constantly evolving body of knowledge that is built upon previous discoveries and is always subject to revision and refinement.

Science can be divided into different branches based on the subject of study. The physical sciences study the inorganic world and comprise fields such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, and Earth science. The biological sciences study the organic world of life and its processes and include fields such as biology and medicine. The social sciences study human behavior and society and include fields such as psychology, sociology, economics, and anthropology.

Science has had a profound impact on our lives by providing us with a deeper understanding of the natural world and by enabling us to develop new technologies that have transformed every aspect of our existence. From medicine to transportation to communication to energy production, science has played a crucial role in shaping the world we live in today.
